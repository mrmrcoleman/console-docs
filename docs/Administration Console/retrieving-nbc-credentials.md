# Retrieving the NetBox Cloud Admin Credentials 

To log into a NetBox Cloud instance with the **admin** username and password, you first need to login to the Admin Console and then retrieve the credentials. Follow these steps: 

1. Login to [Admin Console](https://console.netboxlabs.com/) and you will see (and be able to administer) all the NetBox Cloud instances running under your Organization. In the example screenshot below there are two instances running (dev and prod):
