# Managing Database Snapshots

Currently you can do the following with Database snapshots in the admin dashboard: 

- View a list of available snapshots
- Take a new snapshot
- Delete a snapshot 

To manage your NetBox Cloud Database Snapshots, follow these steps: 

## View Available Snapshots
Scroll down to the ‘Database Snapshots’ section of the admin dashboard. From here, you can view a list of all the available snapshots for your instance. If you need to refresh the list at any time, click the blue ‘refresh’ icon in the top right corner:

## Take a New Database Snapshot
Scroll down to the ‘Database Snapshots’ section of the admin dashboard. From here, you can view a list of all the available snapshots for your instance. If you need to refresh the list at any time, click the blue ‘refresh’ icon in the top right corner:

The amount of time it takes to complete a snapshot will depend on the size of your database, but generally after a few minutes the snapshot will be complete, and the status will change to ‘available’:

Double-check that are deleting the snapshot you intend to, and then confirm the deletion by entering the word ‘delete’ in the dialog box, and clicking on the trash icon on the right hand side:
