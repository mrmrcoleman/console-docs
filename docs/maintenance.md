# Weekly Routine NetBox Cloud Maintenance

The NetBox Cloud platform has weekly maintenance windows on Tuesday and Thursday from 3:00-5:00am EDT / 12:00-2:00am PDT / 7:00-8:00am UTC. 

We do not typically expect downtime during these windows, and if anything, it should be on the order of a few minutes if your instance needs to restart. If you have any jobs running during this window, we recommend you shift the window to a different time if it isnâ€™t too difficult.

If you have any concerns around this then please reach to to the [NetBox Labs Support Team](mailto:support@netboxlabs.com)
